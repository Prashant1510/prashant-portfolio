                        controlled by an app using smartphone it work on 12v and uses geared moters for better torque on
                        single charge it runs upto 20min it is rechargable and after attaching a light weight solar
                        panel it can work and charge simultaneously. it also have rear and tail light.</p>

                        focus on any project is to minimize the cost as less as i can, so i use plastic bottle and
                        plastic board as a base it work fine but after more than 15min it stop working due to heating
                        issue because the motors are using more current so i decide to change the motor driver using
                        stronger one, but never done it due to budget. </p>

                        using laser light which can be increase to any length and bend using prism, it uses a LDR sensor
                        to detect laser light and when any object comes between light and sensor it start beeping using
