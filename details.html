                "Hello everyone.

                My name is Prashant Maurya and I am currently an engineering student pursuing my undergraduate degree in
                Computer Science and Engineering(AI) branch.
                I am extremely passionate about this exciting field that combines my love for technology and
                problem-solving.
                From a young age, I have always been intrigued by computers and their endless possibilities which
                eventually led me to choose CS as my career path.

                Throughout my academic journey, I have gained knowledge and expertise in various areas of computer
                science such as programming languages algorithms data structures software development and artificial
                intelligence.

                These subjects have not only challenged me intellectually but have also sparked my creativity in finding
                innovative solutions to complex problems.

                As an engineering student specializing in CSE(AI), I am excited about the continuous advancements in
                technology and the role that I can play in shaping the future. I believe that my strong foundation in CS
                coupled with my determination and eagerness to learn will enable me to make a meaningful contribution to
                the field.

                I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and skills through further academic pursuits internships
                and research opportunities. I am also looking forward to engaging with fellow students professors and
                professionals to collaborate on exciting projects and gain valuable insights.

                I am thrilled to be a part of this dynamic and rapidly evolving field and I am confident that my
                dedication and hard work will pave the way for a successful career in engineering".
                Thank You.

        <h2>My Engineering and Programming journey</h2>
        <p>
            I am persuing my B.tech degree in field of Computer Science and Engineering(AI), learning AI is a great
            opportunity for me <br>
            Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart
            machines
            capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. While AI is an interdisciplinary
            science
            with multiple approaches, advancements in machine learning and deep learning, in particular, are creating a
            paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.

            Artificial intelligence allows machines to model, or even improve upon, the capabilities of the human mind.
            And
            from the development of self-driving cars to the proliferation of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and
            Google’s
            Bard, AI is increasingly becoming part of everyday life — and an area companies across every industry are
            investing in.

        <h2>DIY Projects</h2>
        <p>
            From my childhood I was very facinated about how electrical and electronics devices work. from where my
            curiosity in engineering
            starts increasing and I decide to study in engineering field, so firstly I have done Diploma in Electrical
            Engineering form Mahamaya
            Polytechnic of Information Technology, Sant Kabir Nagar where I learn about Transmission line, power house,
            different type of electricity
            generation methods, electrical machines e.t.c and In my diploma period I have build many projects some are
            mention in project section. and after diploma currently I am doing B.Tech in computer Science and that help
            to
            increase my knowledge by this understanding of some mordern day technology like self deiving cars, 3D
            printing technology
            become more and more clear.
